            <Paragraph>I am doing this because I am curious in other people's setups, so I want to share in that content! The theme you will see with my setup
            is that I separate the look of my home and work setup because when I am at home, it is more for fun and on my pet projects. For work, I like
            to set up the mindset that I am focusing on work-related tasks. With that, off we go!</Paragraph>

                    15-inch MacBook Pro in November 2018</a> after my <a href ="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.4-13-late-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html">13-inch MacBook Pro (late 2011)</a> became so slow that I could not handle coding on it anymore.
                    I am not sad about it, it took me through my last two years of college, my early professional career,
                    and a coding bootcamp. It still works. My new laptop is a lot faster with a lot more screen real estate. It is like night and day!</Paragraph></li>

                    I also did not like all the setup required on Sublime.</Paragraph>

                            Mina Markham's <a href="https://github.com/minamarkham/yonce">
                            Yonc&eacute; theme</a>, and anything in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme">Material Theme family</a>. As long as it is a dark high-contrast theme, 
                            it is good in my eyes. Dark high-contrast themes help with preventing migraines.</Paragraph>
