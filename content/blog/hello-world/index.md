## Been a long time. Shouldn't have left you. Without, at the very least, a dope beat to step to.

This is kind of a mess right now. But at least I am putting out something, rather than waiting for this to be perfect like I usually do. As of writing, life is pretty alright. I have a good job. I have a place that I can call my own. My mood is pretty stable. My family is okay. More iterations are being done to get this right, but I hope that I can be consistent enough to document enough new learning to get a well-rounded picture of what my career is about.

Until next time 👋🏾
