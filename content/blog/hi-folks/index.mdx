I new a few posts to warm up with because I haven't done any personal writing in so long!

So recently, I switched to doing React Native development at work. I gotta say, I really like it. But the
pain points are really, really painful.

Let's first talk about the things I like about it--creating apps for both iOS and Android without having to
know both Java and Swift at the same time. Actually, I do know a tiny bit of Java from CS classes way back
when, but I would rather not revisit that. It also helps to have a setup that is not Expo. I want to learn on
my own time how to remove Expo from a React Native setup. I think that will be my next project.

Now I can talk about my two pain points. 
 - First, why does Android make everything so difficult? Most things seem
to work so simply on iOS, but then there are an extra three steps on Android that you have to search the internet for.
Android development makes a lot of things difficult and one goal that I would like to hit with this blog is the why and how
to overcome said obstacles. 
 - Tooling. This has gotten better very recently, but it was a guessing game to see the DOM tree before.

I will expand upon these in the future. [Let me know on Twitter what you think](http://twitter.com/jmdembe)
